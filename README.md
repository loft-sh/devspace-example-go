## Getting Started with DevSpace
The first step is installing the DevSpace CLI. The method varies based on your platform, so head over to the [DevSpace documentation](https://www.devspace.sh/docs/getting-started/installation) and select your preferred method. Once installed, head back here to get started with DevSpace by following these step-by-step guides. For each step, change directory into the folder and follow the instructions in the README. These are designed to progressively build an example application, so it's best to go through them in order instead of skipping ahead.
